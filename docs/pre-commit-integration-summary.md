## The 11 Pre-Commit Checks

All enforced by `./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh`:

1. ‚úÖ **Lint** - Zero warnings (`npm run lint:ci`)
2. ‚úÖ **Dependency boundaries** - No violations (`npm run depcruise`)
3. ‚úÖ **Type checking** - All types valid (`npm run type-check`)
4. ‚úÖ **Server install** - Dependencies up to date
5. ‚úÖ **Shared build** - Package builds successfully
6. ‚úÖ **Test suite** - All tests pass (including integration, error-simulation, performance)
7. ‚úÖ **Cleanup** - Temporary directories removed
8. ‚úÖ **DB migrations** - Up to date if schema changed
9. ‚úÖ **Plan updates** - Required files updated (packages/shared/, server/src/, etc.)
10. ‚úÖ **Console checks** - No inappropriate console.* calls
11. ‚úÖ **ADR review** - Updated if decisions changed

## Integration Points

### Before Every Commit
Developers run:
```bash
./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh
```

### When Marking Tasks Complete
Before checking `[x]` on any workpackage in:
- `docs/phoTool.plan.md`
- `docs/refactoring-implementation-plan.md`

### In PR Reviews
PR template includes complete pre-commit checklist verification

### Automated Enforcement
- Pre-commit hook (via Husky) runs subset automatically
- Pre-push hook runs full test suite
- CI runs complete validation

---

## Developer Workflow

```bash
# 1. Work on a workpackage
git checkout -b feat/wp-1.1-error-handling

# 2. Implement and test
# ... make changes ...
npm run test

# 3. Before committing - run pre-commit check
./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh

# 4. If all pass, commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: WP-1.1 enhanced error handling"

# 5. Pre-commit hook runs automatically
# (lint, type-check, depcruise)

# 6. Push triggers pre-push hook
git push
# (full test suite runs)

# 7. CI validates everything
# (complete pre-commit checklist + additional checks)
```

---

## Benefits

### For Developers
- **Clear expectations**: Know exactly what must pass
- **Early detection**: Catch issues before CI
- **Automation**: One command runs all checks
- **Fast feedback**: Color-coded, immediate results

### For Code Quality
- **Consistency**: Every commit meets standards
- **No drift**: Plan documents stay in sync with code
- **Test coverage**: Integration and performance tests required
- **Clean history**: Only quality code committed

### For Project
- **Predictable**: Every workpackage follows same process
- **Maintainable**: Comprehensive checks prevent technical debt
- **Documented**: Clear process for all contributors
- **Scalable**: Process works for 1 or 100 workpackages

## Next Steps

### For Developers Starting Work
1. Read `docs/refactoring-implementation-plan.md` for workpackage structure
2. Bookmark `./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh` command
3. Run the script after completing each workpackage
4. Review `docs/Rules.md` for detailed guidelines

### For Team Leads
1. Ensure all developers are aware of the pre-commit requirement
2. Include script execution in onboarding
3. Reference in PR reviews
4. Monitor that script continues to align with Rules.md

## Testing the Script

```bash
# Test the script works
./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh

# Should see:
# ========================================
# üîç Pre-Commit Checklist
# ========================================
# 
# 1Ô∏è‚É£  Checking lint (zero warnings)...
# [lint:ci] ‚úÖ PASS
# 
# ... (more checks)
#
# ========================================
# ‚úÖ ALL CHECKS PASSED (or ‚ùå SOME CHECKS FAILED)
# ========================================
```

---

## Maintenance

The script should be updated if:
- New checks are added to `Rules.md` pre-commit checklist
- Existing check commands change
- New workspaces are added to the monorepo
- Test organization changes (e.g., new test types)

**Process**: Update script ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Update README ‚Üí Commit
